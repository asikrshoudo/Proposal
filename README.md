# 💛 For Tasnia - The Proposal That Never Happened 😅

This is a beautiful, interactive, and mobile-responsive web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it looks like a serious romantic gesture, it has a hilarious backstory!

## 📜 The "True" Story
To be honest, I didn't build this for my own proposal! This was a fun little project I made for a friend who requested it. Unfortunately, the plan didn't go as expected—let's just say the proposal never happened and the mission was aborted! 😂 However, I didn't want my hard work and the code to go to waste, so I decided to preserve it here on GitHub for anyone who wants to see or use it.
